What is git?

A “version control system”
A history of everything you do to your files
A graph of “states” in which your files has existed


git repository is a set of points in time, with history showing where you've been.

Each point has a name (here A, B, C) that uniquely identifies it, called a hash

The path from one point to the previous is represented by the differencebetween the two points.
